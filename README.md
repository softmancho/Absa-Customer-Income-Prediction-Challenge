# Absa-Customer-Income-Prediction-Challenge
Retail banking is the visible face of banking to the general public, with bank branches located in abundance in most major cities. In retail banking, understanding customer behaviour is a critical part of planning for and meeting customers’ needs.

The objective of this challenge is to create a machine learning solution to predict a customer’s income, based on their transaction history over a fourteen-month period.

This solution will enable Absa to anticipate their customers’ needs, and allow them to offer optimal solutions to their customers.

One of my proudest projects has been developing a machine learning solution for predicting customers' income based on their transaction history over a fourteen-month period. This project was aimed at enhancing Absa's ability to understand customer behavior and anticipate their needs, thus enabling them to offer optimal solutions to their customers in retail banking.
